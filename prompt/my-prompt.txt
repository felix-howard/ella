read @input-docs\project-manifesto.md to understand my problem,
  basically, My cpas got a problem that they have to text with client back and
  forth to chasing missing, blurry documents for tax, and they have to data
  entry into tax software which take too much of their time. They want to
  offshore the docs chasing and data entry to vietnamese staff. My software help
  streamline this process, help the vietnamese staff easily do this, so that,
  vietnamese staff can have a unified place for docs, can check what docs is
  missing in the checklist, can ask them for docs, know what docs is what, know
  what is missing, can text or call client, and when docs are enoguh, staff do
  the entry the data into the tax software, cpa only need to review and efile,
  advisory. Im also thinking of AI to auto-rename docs sent by client and ocr to
  extract data so staff only need to verify AI output. THe client is vietnamese
  nail spa salon, nail tech. These people don't like install a complicated
  portal app to upload their docs, they usually just take photos of all of the
  docs, file they have, that they don't even know what file is file, they just
  take photos of them all and send all of them to my sms message, they don't
  know what they need, they just send them, previously, CPAs  don't know which
  clients's docs are enough to start data entry, sometimes docs is missing,
  sometimes docs images are blurry which require cpa have to chatting back and
  forth with clients to ask for docs, and docs manament previously are scatter
  all over the places, cpa have to download image from their sms, pass them to
  computer, rename them, checking if docs are clear, if docs blurry, they have
  to chat again to ask for better docs, then they check if all docs are
  enough,based on their checklist, depend on the client. then they start data
  entry. the data entry is not required a degree CPA to do, but it take most of
  their time, so they want to offshore to vietnamese staff to do this. for
  checklist, cpa give me 3: 1040 pdf checklist, 1065 checklist, 1120s checklist

  The solution I have in that project-manifesto is just my initial thinking to
  solve this problem. I want to listen to  your point, your approach, so see
  that if you think my solution is valid, or you have an even better approach to
  design this product software to better solve this problem
  to be honest, Im still not sure if my solution is best at solve this problem or not, it just my initial thought. Im still un-sure of how my solfware Ella should have what features, I still don't know how many tabs Ella should have, how each tab/page should look like, the wireframe for every screen. How to design the software to best solve this
